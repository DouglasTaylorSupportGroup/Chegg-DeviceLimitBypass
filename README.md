# Chegg-DeviceLimitBypass

This is a simple extension that hides the annyoing device limit popup when viewing Chegg solutions and allows you to keep using the site without authenticating your device.

## Installation

Just simply download the latest dist.zip file in [Releases](https://github.com/DouglasTaylorSupportGroup/Chegg-DeviceLimitBypass/releases) and load it to your browser's extensions.

I'll upload it to Firefox Addons one day.
